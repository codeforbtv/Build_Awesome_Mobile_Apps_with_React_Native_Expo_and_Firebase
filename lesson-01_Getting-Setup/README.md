# Lesson One: Getting Setup

Before you can do any coding you need to have the proper development environment. Each operating system has a different setup so pick the instructions that match your computer.

While React Native is compatible with iOS and Android, you will only be able to develop and debug on iOS if you have a Mac. If you're using Windows or Linux, don't fret. You can still use the Android emulator to create your app.
