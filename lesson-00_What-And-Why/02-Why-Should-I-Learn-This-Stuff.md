# Why Should I learn React Native, Expo and Firebase?

There are lots of technologies for building mobile applications, so why learn these?

React Native :

React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces, created and open-sourced by Facebook. Evolving beyond MVC (Module-View-Controller), React couples the logic and view into one file using component-based architecture. Besides Facebook, React is also used by Instagram, Netflix, Paypal, and Apple -- and is the core of Code for BTV's Mobile Apps Stack.  React can also be used to produce web applications, native mobile apps, command line interfaces, avionics and much more.

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.  React Native exposes JavaScript interfaces for platform APIs, so React Native apps can access platform features like the phone camera, or the user's location.
