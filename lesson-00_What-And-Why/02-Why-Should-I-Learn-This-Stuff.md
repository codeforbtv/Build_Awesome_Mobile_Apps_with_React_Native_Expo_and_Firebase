# Why Should I learn React Native, Expo and Firebase?

There are lots of technologies for building mobile applications, so why learn these?

React Native :

React.js is a Javascript library for building user interfaces, created and open-sourced by Facebook. Evolving beyond MVC (Module-View-Controller), React couples the logic and view into one file using component-based architecture. Besides Facebook, React is also used by Instagram, Netflix, Paypal, and Apple -- and is the core of Code for BTV's Mobile Apps Stack.  React can also be used to produce web applications, native mobile apps, command line interfaces, avionics and much more.

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.  React Native exposes JavaScript interfaces for platform APIs, so React Native apps can access platform features like the phone camera, or the user's location.

Expo : 

Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps with JavaScript and React.Expo offers a set of tools and services for building, deploying, and quickly iterating on native iOS, Android, and web apps from the same codebase.  Expo enables the developer to test on a real device without having an Apple Developer Account via a free Expo app in the Google Play and App Store, opened by capturing a QR code displayed by the desktop app. 

Expo has an SDK to handle device interfaces like using the camera, accelerometer, maps, location tracking, analytics, etc. Expo also provides UI components to handle a variety of use-cases that almost all apps will cover but are not built into React Native core, e.g. icons, blur views, and more.
