To access your app, open the URL that appears at the end of the publishing process.  You should be taken to the page for your app.  To launch your app, scan the UPC symbol like you normally would or use the "Request a link" box to send yourself a link.  The app will open in Expo.  
The Expo app will save the link so you only need to visit this page once.  Afterwards, you only need to open the Expo app and click the link to your app to access it.
